Aerodynamic downforce slowly gained importance in car design with the appearance of aerofoils during the 1968 season. The wings were introduced by Lotus's owner Colin Chapman who installed modest front wings and a rear spoiler on his Lotus 49B at the 1968 Monaco Grand Prix. In the late 1970s, Lotus introduced ground-effect aerodynamics, previously used on Jim Hall's Chaparral 2J in 1970, that provided enormous downforce and greatly increased cornering speeds. The aerodynamic forces pressing the cars to the track were up to five times the car's weight. As a result, extremely stiff springs were needed to maintain a constant ride height, leaving the suspension virtually solid. This meant that the drivers depended entirely on the tyres for any small amount of cushioning of the car and driver from irregularities of the road surface.

The modern Formula One car is a single-seat, open-cockpit, open-wheel racing car with substantial front and rear wings, large wheels, and a turbocharged engine positioned behind the driver. The monocoque is constructed of reinforced carbon fibre, lined with kevlar and fire resistant materials to protect the drivers from high impact crashes and fires. The driver cockpit consists of single seat with a detachable steering wheel in the front. There is a halo mounted on top of the open cockpit, which was introduced in 2018. Two front and rear wheels are bolted to the suspension and the engine is mounted behind the driver. The front and rear wings are aerodynamic surfaces fitted on the extremes. The minimum weight permissible is 798 kg (1,759 lb) including the driver, while fitted with dry-weather tyres and no fuel. The cars are limited to dimensions of 5.63 m (18.5 ft) in length, 2 m (6 ft 7 in) in width, and 0.9 m (2 ft 11 in) in height.

Since its inception, Formula One has used a number of different engine regulations. During the early years, a front-engine, four-wheel-drive layout was used with a 4.5 L naturally aspirated or a 1.5 L supercharged engine capable of an output power of up to 317 kW (425 hp). Progressively the engine capacity and power were reduced, and was limited to 0.75 L with compressor or 2.5 L without one during the late 1950s. In 1961, the engine was positioned behind the driver and the capacity was regulated to 1300–1500 cc with a power output of 150–225 hp without supercharging. In 1966, FIA increased engine capacity and allowed up to 3.0 L atmospheric with a power range of 290–370 kW (390–500 hp) or 1.5 L supercharged with a power range of 370–670 kW (500–900 hp). While the basic structure and configuration of a Formula One remained same since the late 1960s, the power output of the engines increased progressively to 1,000 kW (1,400 hp) at 12000 rpm in 1986. In 1987-88, turbocharged eight-cylinder engines were introduced alongside atmospheric engines with fuel caps for races introduced for turbocharged engines. Turbochargers were banned from 1989 with 3.0 L engines becoming the norm in the 1990s and led to the introduction of V10 and V12 engines.
