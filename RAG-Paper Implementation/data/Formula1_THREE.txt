The teams started constructing engine components using advanced metal alloys such as titanium and beryllium, which reduced weight and improved the efficiency and durability. FIA outlawed the use of these towards the late 1990s with only iron and aluminum permitted. The introduction of pneumatic valve springs in the same period allowed the engines to reach up to 20,000 rpm. For a decade, the F1 cars had run with 3.0 L naturally aspirated V10 engines producing 730–750 kW (980–1,000 hp) of power with top speeds of up to 375 km/h (233 mph). Though the FIA continually enforced material and design restrictions to limit power, the V10s in the 2005 season were reported to develop 730 kW (980 hp), power levels not seen since the ban on turbocharged engines in 1989. Before the 2006 season, FIA introduced a new engine formula, which mandated cars to be powered by 2.4 liter naturally aspirated V8 engine configuration, with no more than four valves per cylinder and banned variable intake trumpets. For the 2009 season, the engines were limited to 18,000 rpm to improve engine reliability and cut costs. In 2012, the engines consumed around 450 L (16 cu ft) of air per second with a race fuel consumption rate of 75 L/100 km (3.8 mpg‑imp; 3.1 mpg‑US).

While conventional manual gearboxes were used earlier, modern Formula One cars use semi-automatic sequential gearboxes with a rear-wheel-drive. It has eight forward gears and a reverse gear operated with paddle-shifters. The gearbox is constructed of carbon reinforced titanium, and is bolted onto the back of the engine. Fully-automatic gearboxes, and systems such as launch control and traction control were banned in the 2000s to keep driver skill and involvement important in controlling the car, and reduce costs. When the driver initiates gear shifts using paddles mounted on the back of the steering wheel, a system of solenoids, hydraulic actuators, and sensors perform the actual shift, and electronic throttle control. Clutch control is also performed in the same manner except when launching from neutral into first gear, where the driver operates the clutch manually using a lever on the back of the steering wheel. The clutch is a multi-plate carbon design with a diameter of less than 100 mm (3.9 in), and weight of less than 1 kg (2.2 lb), capable of handling up to 540 kW (720 hp). The cars use seamless shift transmissions, which allow almost instantaneous changing of gears with minimum loss of drive and a shift times of 2–3 ms. As a measure to reduce costs, gearbox ratios are fixed for a season.

During the 1950s and 1960s, Formula One tyres were treaded rubber tyres similar to the automobile tyres but larger. In the late 1950s, cotton fabric was replaced with nylon fabric, which reduced weight and increased durability. In the 1960s, the tyres became wider and synthetic rubber was used along with nylon. Slick tyres were introduced for the first time during the 1971 season. In the 1975 season, the cars used 26.0"×16.2"–13" slick tyre (diameter × width) in the rear on a 13"×18" rim, and a 20.0"×9.2"–13" slick tyre in the front on a 13×10" rim. For the 1981 season, the maximum diameter of the rear tyre was limited to 26.0", and the diameter of the front tyres was increased, with the tyres measuring 25.0"×10.0"–13" in the front and 26.0"×15.0"–13" in the rear. Ahead of the 1993 season, the width of the rear was reduced from 18" to 15". In 1998, grooved tyres were introduced with three groove lines in the front tyres and four groove lines in the rear tyres. Between 1999 and 2008, regulations required the tyres to feature a minimum of four 14 mm (0.55 in) grooves in them, with the intention of slowing the cars down as the slick tyre, with no indentations, provides the most grip in dry conditions. The tyre sizes were limited to 355 mm (14.0 in) at the front and 380 mm (15 in) at the rear, and the maximum diameter was 660 mm (26 in) for dry and 670 mm (26 in) for wet tyres. Briefly in 2005, tyre changes during the race were outlawed and the tyre compounds were made harder to last the full race distance.
